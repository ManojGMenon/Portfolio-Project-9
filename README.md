# Portfolio-Project-9
IBM Data Science project in Python : Model Development (linear and non-linear regression)

Project Idea : This was one of the modules in the IBM Data Science certification course conducted by Coursera in collaboration with IBM. A dataset was provided with the target of executing all steps in a typical Model Development project. It steps through the steps involved in fitting and evaluating both linear and non-linear regression models

Resources used: Coursera certification course : https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science

Data Source : In the form of a series of csv files was provided in the Coursera Case study

Tools used : Python, Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code

ANALYSIS STEPS:

ASK - Problem description and SOW (see document : Scope of Work)

PREPARE - Data collection and organization. Data was downloaded from Coursera. Reading in the csv files into the Python (VS Code IDE) environment.

PROCESS - No cleaning was required for this dataset as it was prepared for this exercise by Coursera. Cleaning was not in the scope of this exercise.

ANALYZE - Created linear and non linear models. Evaluated each visually using Regression plots, Residual plots, Distribution plots and numerically using R-Squared and Meas Squared Error analysis. (see Jupyter Notebook script : ModelDevelopment.ipynb)

SHARE - Summarized findings, conclusions and recommendations in the same Jupyter Notebook


Note: I recreated the Jupyter notebook step by step in order understand each step of the process (was not just a cut & paste exercise)
